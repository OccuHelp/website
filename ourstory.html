						<h3>The Beginning</h3>
						<p>OccuHelp was founded by a team of occupational health professionals and software engineers who recognized a critical gap in workplace safety technology. After witnessing the limitations of paper-based systems and disconnected software solutions, they set out to create an integrated platform that could truly transform how organizations approach workplace health and safety.</p>

						<h3>First Product Launch</h3>
						<p>After months of development and testing, we launched our first product: a basic incident tracking and reporting system. While simple by today's standards, it laid the foundation for our data-driven approach to workplace safety management.</p>
						<p>Our first clients were small manufacturing companies looking to improve their safety records and streamline compliance reporting. Their feedback was invaluable in shaping our product roadmap.</p>
